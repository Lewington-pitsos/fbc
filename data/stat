FUN FACT: changing the "comment number" gives you different combinations of comments, the same 6 are not always linked together.


R1 = the request that gets the comments


Strategy for a given page:

1. work out exactly how low you have to set the comment number to start getting new comments (see below)
2. set the comment number to that
3. keep sending R1, decreasing the comment number by some small-ish number each time and checking the response
4. If the response has the content-type application-x/javascript, send the comments off to be saved
5. If the response has the content-type text/html, we're done


Strategy for working out how low to set comment number

1. start with stupidly high comment number
2. decrement it a little bit if this is the first time you've reached 2., otherwise decrement by exponentially more than you decremented it last time
3. send R1 and check response with the new comment number
4. if the response is different from last time move to 5, otherwise move to 2

5. Increment the comment number by a small amount if this is the first time you've reached 5, or an exponentially greater amount on all other times
6. send R1 and check response with the new comment number
7. If the response is the original response, the current comment number is the one we want, otherwise go to 5
